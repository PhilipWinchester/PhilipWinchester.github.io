**"I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful." - Warren Buffett.**

Ok, thats sounds easy enough and Warren Buffet arguably (not really) the most successfully investor in the world, so we should probably listen to him. His quote above has been analyzed [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012116/warren-buffett-be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy.asp), [here](http://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy/) and [here](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/4199/investment-warfare-be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy-and-greedy-when-others-are-fearful--warren-buffett) and holds a lot more meaning than when people tell you to "Buy low and sell high". Of course we all want to buy low, but how do we know when the market is low? Well, according to Mr Buffet, when people are fearful and vice verse for when the market is high. Fear and greed are emotions we can measure through reading The FT and talking to people. Hence, it can act as an investment strategy, "Buy low and sell high" can not. Even though a large proportion of the markets trading volume is driven by algorithmic trading, psychological and emotional factors still come into play. Conventional opinion on markets tend to rely on recent development. When market go up, investors become greedy and prices boil over, and one should be cautious lest they overpay for an asset that subsequently leads to anemic returns. When others are fearful, it may present a good value buying opportunity.
