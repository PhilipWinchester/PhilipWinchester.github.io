Oxford Mathematician by day, wannabe data scientist by night. Extremely passionate about beating my friends at Fantasy Premier League. Here I'll show you how.

There may also post on other topics and projects I have been working on for fun. My programming is mostly self taught, so please do feel free to rip it apart and tell me about all the things I can do better.

If you want to get in touch, drop me an email at <a href="mailto:philipwinchester16@gmail.com">philipwinchester16@gmail.com</a>.

My CV can be found <a href="/Data/Curriculum Vitae, Philip Winchester.pdf">here</a>.
